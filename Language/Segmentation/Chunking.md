# Chunking
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_parsing)

> Shallow parsing (also chunking or light parsing) is an analysis of a sentence which first identifies constituent parts of sentences (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and then links them to higher order units that have discrete grammatical meanings (noun groups or phrases, verb groups, etc.).
