  [oxilangtag: Simple and fast implementation of language tag normalization and validation](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxilangtag)
  > If you only want to validate and normalize the formatting of language tags or you are working with RDF consider using the oxilangtag crate. It is much more lightweight as it doesn't contain a language tag database and has a very similar interface to this crate.
  - [Missing attribution - Issue #2 - oxigraph/oxilangtag](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxilangtag/issues/2)
    > oxilangtag is very focus on the Oxigraph/RDF use case: being able to validate is a language tag is well-formed. There is no canonicalization, case normalization... So it's feature scope is pretty closed and I basically have not needed to update it after its first release. Outside of the "missing" features the main difference is that oxilangtag allows zero copy validation and to choose which buffer to use internally.
