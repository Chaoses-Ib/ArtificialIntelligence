[The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Must Know About Unicode in 2023 (Still No Excuses!) @ tonsky.me](https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/) ([r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/178d3co/the_absolute_minimum_every_software_developer/)):
> - Unicode has won.
> - UTF-8 is the most popular encoding for data in transfer and at rest.
> - UTF-16 is still sometimes used as an in-memory representation.
> - The two most important views for strings are bytes (allocate memory/copy/encode/decode) and extended grapheme clusters (all semantic operations).
> - Using code points for iterating over a string is wrong. They are not the basic unit of writing. One grapheme could consist of multiple code points.
> - To detect grapheme boundaries, you need Unicode tables.
> - Use a Unicode library for everything Unicode, even boring stuff like¬†`strlen`,¬†`indexOf`¬†and¬†`substring`.
> - Unicode updates every year, and rules sometimes change.
> - Unicode strings need to be normalized before they can be compared.
> - Unicode depends on locale for some operations and for rendering.
> - All this is important even for pure English text.

## Characters
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set_characters)
- Noncharacters

  The unhyphenated term "noncharacter" refers to 66 code points (labeled `<not a character>`) permanently reserved for internal use, and therefore guaranteed to never be assigned to a character.

  Each of the 17 planes has its two ending code points set aside as noncharacters. So, noncharacters are: U+FFFE and U+FFFF on the BMP, U+1FFFE and U+1FFFF on Plane 1, and so on, up to U+10FFFE and U+10FFFF on Plane 16, for a total of 34 code points. In addition, there is a contiguous range of another 32 noncharacter code points in the BMP: U+FDD0..U+FDEF.

  Software implementations are therefore free to use these code points for internal use. One particularly useful example of a noncharacter is the code point U+FFFE. This code point has the reverse UTF-16/UCS-2 byte sequence of the byte order mark (U+FEFF). If a stream of text contains this noncharacter, this is a good indication the text has been interpreted with the incorrect endianness.
