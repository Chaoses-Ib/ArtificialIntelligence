[The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Must Know About Unicode in 2023 (Still No Excuses!) @ tonsky.me](https://tonsky.me/blog/unicode/) ([r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/178d3co/the_absolute_minimum_every_software_developer/)):
> - Unicode has won.
> - UTF-8 is the most popular encoding for data in transfer and at rest.
> - UTF-16 is still sometimes used as an in-memory representation.
> - The two most important views for strings are bytes (allocate memory/copy/encode/decode) and extended grapheme clusters (all semantic operations).
> - Using code points for iterating over a string is wrong. They are not the basic unit of writing. One grapheme could consist of multiple code points.
> - To detect grapheme boundaries, you need Unicode tables.
> - Use a Unicode library for everything Unicode, even boring stuff like¬†`strlen`,¬†`indexOf`¬†and¬†`substring`.
> - Unicode updates every year, and rules sometimes change.
> - Unicode strings need to be normalized before they can be compared.
> - Unicode depends on locale for some operations and for rendering.
> - All this is important even for pure English text.

## Encodings

## Characters
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set_characters)
- Noncharacters

  The unhyphenated term "noncharacter" refers to 66 code points (labeled `<not a character>`) permanently reserved for internal use, and therefore guaranteed to never be assigned to a character.

  Each of the 17 planes has its two ending code points set aside as noncharacters. So, noncharacters are: U+FFFE and U+FFFF on the BMP, U+1FFFE and U+1FFFF on Plane 1, and so on, up to U+10FFFE and U+10FFFF on Plane 16, for a total of 34 code points. In addition, there is a contiguous range of another 32 noncharacter code points in the BMP: U+FDD0..U+FDEF.

  Software implementations are therefore free to use these code points for internal use. One particularly useful example of a noncharacter is the code point U+FFFE. This code point has the reverse UTF-16/UCS-2 byte sequence of the byte order mark (U+FEFF). If a stream of text contains this noncharacter, this is a good indication the text has been interpreted with the incorrect endianness.

## Newlines
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)

Programming languages:
- `\n` with text/binary mode: C, C++, Perl, Haskell

  > The¬†C programming language¬†provides the¬†escape sequences¬†`'\n'`¬†(newline) and¬†`'\r'`¬†(carriage return). However, these are not required to be equivalent to the ASCII¬†LF¬†and¬†CR¬†control characters. The C standard only guarantees two things:
  > 1. Each of these escape sequences maps to a unique implementation-defined number that can be stored in a single¬†char¬†value.
  > 2. When writing to a file, device node, or socket/fifo in¬†*text mode*,¬†`'\n'`¬†is transparently translated to the native newline sequence used by the system, which may be longer than one character. When reading in text mode, the native newline sequence is translated back to¬†`'\n'`. In¬†*binary mode*, no translation is performed, and the internal representation produced by¬†`'\n'`¬†is output directly.

  > On Unix platforms, where C originated, the native newline sequence is ASCII¬†LF¬†(0x0A), so¬†`'\n'`¬†was simply defined to be that value. With the internal and external representation being identical, the translation performed in text mode is a¬†no-op, and Unix has no notion of text mode or binary mode. This has caused many programmers who developed their software on Unix systems simply to ignore the distinction completely, resulting in code that is not portable to different platforms.

- Auxiliary functions/constants: Python, Java, PHP

  - Python

    > Python permits "Universal Newline Support" when opening a file for reading, when importing modules, and when executing a file.

  - Java

    > The Java I/O libraries do not transparently translate these into platform-dependent newline sequences on input or output. Instead, they provide functions for writing a full line that automatically add the native newline sequence, and functions for reading lines that accept any of¬†CR,¬†LF, or¬†CR+LF¬†as a line terminator (see¬†[BufferedReader.readLine()](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html#readLine%28%29)). The¬†[System.lineSeparator()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#lineSeparator--)¬†method can be used to retrieve the underlying line separator.
  
  - PHP

    > In PHP, to avoid portability problems, newline sequences should be issued using the `PHP_EOL` constant.
