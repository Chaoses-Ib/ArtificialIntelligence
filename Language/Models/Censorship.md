> The way I understand it is that abliterated models use one technique that basically deactivates refusals by removing or bypassing a layer they discovered that manages refusals. Uncensored models are usually trained with new data so rather than bypass it, it's taught to just not refuse - after all, LLMs are "taught" (reinforced) to refuse if they don't align with whatever prudish morals and agenda the money behind it has.

> If the abliterated model didn't have previous knowledge about stuff that is usually censored (and nowadays due to their agendas, when they train LLMs they may purge from the training data anything the moral guardians deem dangerous), then you won't get it. Sure, it won't refuse to do what you asked for, but it will just hallucinate it. It just doesn't know what you are asking for.

> An uncensored model should have additional information so that in theory it can work with the information that may have been withheld from its training. On HF there are hundreds of uncensored training sets. The problem is that it can often become dumber because it "forgets" about its original instruct finetune. Basically, a lot of those training sets are either jailbroken synthetic data from chatGPT and co (horrible way of writing), or else random RP conversations taken from god knows where. In either case, it's likely the original finetune of the model gets dilluted.
